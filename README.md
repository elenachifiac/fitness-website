# [Fitness: Bootstrap 4 website design]

Fitness is a bright and vibrant single page website design written in Bootstrap 4, and serves as a fantastic starting point to get you going on your next website project.

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and Gulp.

Performance basics are covered: unused Bootstrap SCSS is commented out, assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
